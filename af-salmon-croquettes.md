# Salmon croquettes 

Whole air fryer meal??
Salmon croquettes (380 for 16 mins), 
baked potatoes (400 for 40 mins), 
asparagus (400 for 8 mins because they were thick)

Sure. I don't really have a recipe but I use one can of salmon and remove the skin and bones, a nice spoon full of mayo, some chopped onion and pepper, old bay seasoning, garlic, pepper, parsley, one egg, a dab of hot sauce, a splash of lemon juice and some breadcrumbs... patty them out and spray with oil and flip halfway thru..

And the dipping sauce I made for the salmon is mayo, sriacha and a splash of worcheshire sauce??

.....

All I know is he cooked them at 400 for 15 minutes. Turning them over at 7 minutes
