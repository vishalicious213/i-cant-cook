# Salmon croquettes 

Whole air fryer meal??
Salmon croquettes (380 for 16 mins), 
baked potatoes (400 for 40 mins), 
asparagus (400 for 8 mins because they were thick)

Sure. I don't really have a recipe but I use one can of salmon and remove the skin and bones, a nice spoon full of mayo, some chopped onion and pepper, old bay seasoning, garlic, pepper, parsley, one egg, a dab of hot sauce, a splash of lemon juice and some breadcrumbs... patty them out and spray with oil and flip halfway thru..

And the dipping sauce I made for the salmon is mayo, sriacha and a splash of worcheshire sauce??

.....

All I know is he cooked them at 400 for 15 minutes. Turning them over at 7 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 3 tblsp. olive oil, 
- 1 onion finely chopped ( I used green onions- adds nice color- you can go a step further and add chopped red bell peppers, which i wish i had done!) 
- 2 tblsp. chopped fresh parsley or dried.. 
- 7 oz of salmon fresh or canned, 
- 1 egg ( beaten) 1 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 
- 1/2 tsp of each- salt, black pepper, dill

## Recipe: 

- preheat air fryer to 350° 3 min. 
- Cook salmon 5 min. .. 
- while salmon is cooking, sauté onions on medium heat in 2 tblsp. of olive oil on stove til soft, adding the parsley. 
- Set aside. 
- Put cooked salmon in bowl; 
- flake apart salmon... 
- add beaten egg, breadcrumbs, mustard, onion parsley mix, salt, pepper and dill ( mix may be a little dry, so I added 2-3 tblsp of mayo- optional) 
- form into patties, 
- use remaining tblsp. of olive oil to lightly coat patties or spritz them. 
- Cook at 350° for 10 min. or until golden brown.
