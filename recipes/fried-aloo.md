## Fried aloo

- Cut up the aloo thin (mandolin? )
- Wash the aloo and dry it with towel 
- Heat vegetable oil in pot in medium heat
- Add garlic powder and (optional) onion powder to oil and let garlic powder turn brown 
- Add aloo when garlic powder is brown and cook on medium heat 
- Turn aloo so it doesn't stick and so less-cooked pieces are on bottom, frying
    - Don't overturn or it will mash up
- When aloo is halfway cooked, add salt
- Continue frying and turn as needed (took 35 mins when mom did around 5 small aloo)
