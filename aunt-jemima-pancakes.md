# Aunt Jemima Pancakes:

In a bowl, mix all dry ingredients together: 1 1/4 cup all purpose flour, 2 tablespoon sugar, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt.  Make a well in the center of the dry mixture and add 2 eggs and 2 Tbsp vegetable oil.  Gradually  Add in 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cup milk, adding more depending on your desired consistency.  Mix until there are no more lumps.  Heat a non stick pan at medium heat, melt a bit of butter and pour 1/4 cup of the pancake batter; when pancake starts to bubble on top and the cooked side is golden brown, flip it so the other side cooks and turns golden brown as well. Remove pancake from pan; spread some butter on the pancake and drizzle with maple syrup.  The pancakes go well with bacon so try it and enjoy this filling breakfast with your family.
