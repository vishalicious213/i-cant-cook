# Instant Pot Pork Adobo

## Ingredients

- 1 whole head of garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp cooking oil
- 2 lbs pork cut into cubes
- 4 bay leaves
- 1/3 cup white vinegar
- 2/3 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 tsp cornstarch

## Directions

1. In a mixing bowl, add bay leaves, vinegar, soy sauce, water, and brown sugar and mix until brown sugar is completely dissolved. Set aside. 
2. In the Instant Pot, heat oil on sauté mode. Add minced garlic and sauté until halfway cooked. 
3. Add pork and sauté until slightly browned. 
4. Add the adobo marinade and mix well. 
5. Cover Instant Pot, and apply manual high pressure for 15 min. 
6. Once timer goes off, let sit for 2-3 minutes. Then release the extra steam. 
7. Turn Instant Pot to sauté mode and bring to a boil. 
8. Add cornstarch and mix well. 
9. Let adobo continue cooking on sauté mode until sauce and pork tenderness is to your liking.

Note: There will be a layer of fat that sits right above the sauce. I like to remove it the next day after it’s been refrigerated. However, if you’re serving this immediately, you can spoon it out carefully.
