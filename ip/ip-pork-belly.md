# Pork belly

## Ingredients:

- 1 cup aged soy sauce, 
- 4 bay leaves, 
- 1 cup white vinegar, 
- 1 tablespoon of minced garlic, 
- 3 cups water (use less water if you want thicker sauce), 
- teaspoon of garlic salt 

hit the meat/stew for 30mins on high pressure @ normal.

I used 3/4 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of vinegar and 1/2 cup of beef broth. Rubbed pork belly in Adobo powder too.
